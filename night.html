<p id='app'>Paragraph on Save Earth- 150 words for class 4, 5
As human beings, it is our basic duty to care for the planet that we call our home. The Earth provides us with all the basic things that are needed for our survival. Nut, we greedy humans have exploited its resources to such an extent that even the most essentials are not available to some people. Being responsible inhabitants of this planet, we must take some measures to reverse the damage caused to our planet. It has seen a lot of exploitation. We have been cutting trees recklessly for our use. For every tree lost, the Earth loses a part of itself. We must plant as many trees as we can in our limited lifetimes, to bring the previous lush green forests back to life. If we can all plant a sapling each, every year then, the Earth will be filled with nearly 7 billion trees in one year.

Paragraph on Save Earth- 200 words for class 6, 7, 8
The basic needs of man have been easily fulfilled by the Earth for billions of years. But, with the rise of industrialism, we humans have become greedier and reckless. We have been mercilessly plundering the Earth’s resources without giving anything back to it. The principle of the life processes on Earth functions on the basic concept of harmony. There is perfect synchronization between the various levels and spheres of lifelike, the biosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. When all these spheres interact with each other in perfect harmony, we get a healthy and lively Earth. But sadly, we have disrupted the functioning of all those spheres that have led to an imbalance in the synchronization of Earth’s life processes. Choked up rivers, polluted air and lands, debris-filled ocean, and lack of trees is the main reason for this imbalance. But rather than sitting and crying over what has gone wrong, we must act with urgency. Some crucial steps need to be taken to restore Earth to its previous glory. Some of those steps are: planting more trees to improve air quality, not allowing unchecked sewage to be dumped directly into rivers, keeping an eye on industrialists who flout pollution norms, and, most importantly, judging our actions from a moral standpoint.
